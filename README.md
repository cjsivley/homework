<i>CS homework from Athens State</i>

This is a bunch of my homework from Athens State University CS courses.
Dr. Lewis and Dr. Maxwell give some tough assignments, but as long as you are able to articulate your thought process, they'll grade you fairly.

This code is from when I was doing the homework and hasn't been cleaned up since whatever semester or due date, so be mindful that there may be errors or other problems.
