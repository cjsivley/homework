	<h1> Codey Sivley Course Schedule</h1>
	<h5> Spring Semester 2022 </h5>
	<p> These are my classes. I wish I had more time to enjoy them but instead I must contribute to capitalism, and thus I am forced to rush through them. </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Fall 2021</li>
		<dl>
			<dt> CS 414 - Programming Languages </dt>
				<dd> This class was an interesting foray into different types of programming languages. 
				Our education tends to lean towards object oriented code, so functional programming was challenging to implement.
				There were several students who complained heartily about using Scheme and Lisp. Cry me a river. Backus-Naur Form says hello. </dd>
			<dt> CS 417 - Object Oriented Programming </dt>
				<dd> This course was a good "bread and butter" computing course. Could easily be called "CS 417 - Design Patterns." Much was learned about iterators. </dd>
			<dt> MA 310 - Linear Algebra & Matrices </dt>
				<dd> Very interesting but a heavy workload. Eigenvalues are cool but challenging. Unfortunately had to drop just before finals. </dd>
			<dt> MA 227 - Calculus III </dt>
				<dd> Everything that wouldn't fit into Calc II. Intro to multivariable calculus & vector calculus. </dd>
		</dl>
		
		<li>Spring 2022</li>
		<dl>
			<dt> CS 472 - Algorithms </dt>
				<dd> Discrete mathematics and depression. </dd>
			<dt> CS 415 - Operating Systems </dt>
				<dd> Make your own BASH, and learn what happens when you hit the big orange power button. </dd>
			<dt> CS 380 - Programming for the Web </dt>
				<dd> Starting off nice and easy with HTML. Beyond here there be dragons. </dd>
		</dl>
		<li>Summer 2022</li>
		<dl>
			<dt> CS Embedded Systems </dt>
				<dd> Interfacing with ARM microcontrollers and things without screens. </dd>
			<dt> MA 310 - Linear Algebra & Matrices </dt>
				<dd> Will try this again, with less despair. </dd>
			<dt> That Class You Need Before Capstone </dt>
				<dd> Fall is going to be a tough semester. </dd>
		</dl>
	</ul>
